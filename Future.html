            Looking more into the future, I am currelty looking for opportunities with companies in order to gain more knowledge in the field. 
            I have also applied for Masters programs in order to study specifically what I found interesting throughout my College years while studying C.S. 
            To continue school is what I want to do and to continue learning as well so that there is never a point in which everything becomes stagnant. 
            There are times when I have thought I have hit a wall and could not go any further, but taking a break for a little to get a new perspective helped 
            tremendously with this. One thing that I do plan on learning more about is Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Many people have said it before 
            that this is what they want to study, however for me this is something that I find the most interesting. As Artifical Intelligence with Neural Networks 
            is supposed to closely mimic the brain so that it shows how we learn for a computer to visualize as well. This is something that I do find interesting and
            want to look further into it. Not only for my masters program, but for my self learning as well. I want to be able to help push technology forward.
            <br />
            Currently I am learning more about different frameworks in order to help my learning as well. Two of them being TensorFlow and PyTorch. First learning more
            about PyTorch and then going further with TensorFlow in order to gain the most out of my learning. After I will be continuing my research from a masters 
            into a PhD if everything goes well and feel as though I can do more with what I have created.
