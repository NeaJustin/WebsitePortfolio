        <h3>Land Surveyor: </h3>
        <p>
            Land Surveryor is a project that was proposed to us by our professor and client. It was a concept idea and we had implemented the 
            beginning stages of the application for Android Development. The main purpose of the application was to take a segment of land on a map
            and to be able too see how much the land actually is for measurements in Hectares. This was done using bearings for the coordinates, and we
            also implemented it to drop pins and that would also give the area as well. 
            We were working a lot with the client for specifics and what they wanted within the application, and seeing his bigger picture, we wanted to 
            give him the best starting foundation so that way others would be able to work on the application further.

        <h3>Resume Matching: </h3>
        <p>
            Resume Matching is not complete as it is a work in progress. However, my thought for this is that it would take in a resume from anyone, 
            and it would then take in a job posting or any kind of listing whatever it may be that others are comparing it too, and it would then
            give them a percentage of what it would be to match for that specific listing. My initial thought was to create this in Python, and looking
            at the libraries and frameworks it is possible, but doing this within C++ would also be beneficial and that is the way I am leaning towards to 
            finish the project. I also want to implement a way in order to have the person gain feedback and a way to change their resume to be better by 
            giving some advice on what to change if not that great of a match by taking keywords from the listing and their resume. 
            <br />
            It would be a difficult task but one that would be rewarding and would not only help me but others as well as they continue to search for jobs. 
            This could be used in a variety of different ways as well and not just for the sole purpose of matching with specific job listings. 
            It could be used for companies to run the program and see who is able to match the most and it takes out much time from having to read each 
            resume and could be more efficient. This would not be able to be done for a while though as it would need to be fine tuned and have to be done
            without much bias. There is a lot of factors in creating this and the beginning stages would be used for the purposes above.

        <h3>Deep Learning with Neural Networks: </h3>
        <p>
            After going through both the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Course it really intrigued me how a machine can learn from the ground up. 
            It did made me look at everything a lot differently and sure it is very slow still compared to what they want to make it, but it is still a great
            thing to look at to see the progress in what we can have a machine do. 
            <br />
            After looking further, I was looking more into applications for this topic and there are many already wanting know more about it. This field is what
            I want to do pursue my Master's thesis on as the field is constantly evolving. I want to create a project that can not only be used for educational 
            purposes, but one that can also be used anywhere with simple tools that can change the way people view other fields as well and not just C.S. in particular. 
            Not only that, but to challenge others to think differently and to influence change and research to advance far more other things within the world so that
            we can continue learning more and more about what we want and see greater research come out.
