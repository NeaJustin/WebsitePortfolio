            Introduction:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Hello, My name is Justin Pulido and I am a recent graduate from California State University San Bernardino with a B.S. in Computer Science. <br />
            I have also obtained a minor in Japanese as I found it interesting to learn a new language and learn about other cultures.

            After going through my course work, I found myself wanting to understand more about Software Development and the process in how everything comes together.
            When going through my course work, it was fun as I was challenged to think differently than what I had learned and was looking for new ways to solve the problem at hand.
            Later on when I finished my pre-requisites for my course work, I started looking into side projects for myself and further interests during my schooling.
            <br />
            One of them being about Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Specifically Deep Learning. Going deeper into the subject I started to learn about different languages
            that can have many frameworks to help with this type of interest. After learning about it I started to study Python and its libraries and frameworks such as PyTorch,
            TensorFlow, MatPlotLib, Numpy, etc... in how they are used for specific puposes.
