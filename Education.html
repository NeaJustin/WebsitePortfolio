        <p>During my education at CSUSB, there were many core course that I took and many I took for my minor as well.</p>

            <h3>CSE 330: Data Structures</h3>
            <p>
                During my Data Structures course, we went over structure such as linked list, doubly linked list, Vectors, etc...
                <br />
                Under my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/justinhigh/cse330">CSE 330</a> is a list of my course work for CSE 330.
                Each lab containing a different assignment each week and also having homework assignments to help ensure we understand what we previously learned.
                It was rigorous but it was rewarding in that it did help me understand how each class does work. 
            </p>
            
            <h3>CSE 431: Algorithm Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Algorithm Analysis is one that was extensively covered in that it was a lot of understanding heaps and sorting algorithms to imrpove time complexity. 
                One of the main things was understanding why a program would take O(n), n^2, linear time, or it could be O(nlogn). 
                Each one varying based on what the algorithm was, how we found it through proofs or through proof by induction. 
                Also, when going through more proofs and from there finding ways to improve on the algorithm. 
                One example would be merge sort in imporving the time complexity. Or using a sift-down algorithm to sort a binary tree when given an array of numbers being added in random order. 
            </p>
            
            <h3>CSE 460: Operating Systems</h3>
            <p>
                Github: <a href="https://github.com/justinhigh/cse460">CSE 460</a>
                For CSE 460, we were put into groups and the labs were broken up into three phases. Each phase consisting of different parts that would be used for the project.
                <br />
                It consisted of learning about memory management, time splicing, creating object files for the op codes to run, creating op codes to translate to bits,
                creating an 3 different registers such as general purpose registers, SR (Status Register), and IR (Instruction Register). 
                Throughout the project, we started implementing more things to help make it simulate an operating system such as paging, multi-threading, scheduling, 
                and more things throughout. Each phase of the project can be found using the github link. Not all was created by me, some of it was provided in the beginning of the project.
