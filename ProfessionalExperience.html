        <button class="accordion">PrimeHealthcare</button>
        <div class="panel">
            Working as an IT-HelpDesk Operator going through trouble shooting with end users to ensure that I would be able to solve the issue. Sometimes it is small
            things that are easy to fix but sometimes there are issues that are out of my hand. I will usually explain to the person the reason they are expriencing this
            issue is due to a server side issue or something that could have been a bug within the system itself. Other times I will direct service requests to the correct
            local technicians so that they are able to complete those tasks and have them all fixed by the time they are using the machines again.

        <button class="accordion">CSE Tutor for Artificial Intelligence</button>
        <div class="panel">
            During my tutor for Computer Science, I was in charge of the labs for student and if they had any questions they would come and ask me or the professor for any
            help regarding the assignment. The students were able to create the programs in 3 different languages such as Java, Python, or C++. Each one having their own
            difficulties. I would help students if they ran into any issues on either one and after going through their work I would explain what would be causing the issue
            and some ways on how to fix them. There would also be times when students would ask questions about homework assignments or how the algorithm would work. I would
            then explain how to use the algorithm writtenly and go through examples and how they should be going through it as well. One of them being A* as it takes in
            alpha, beta and the actual value of it for minimax. After it would prune the tree so that way it can be more time efficient. Many students had a good understanding
            of this already but there were some parts that were not completely clear to them and when they asked me questions I would clarify it for them.

        <button class="accordion">Software Developer Internship</button>
        <div class="panel">
            While working for Phi Beta Delta during the Internship, we were mainly using Node.js for the framework and using PHP and JQuery. During this time,
            I was tasked with creating more backend functionality for admin users. One of them was to give them the ability to change the content of the website when needed
            so that way they do not need to have software developers change it for them. If they are an admin user it will have the boxes with editable content in order
            to make changes as needed and it would take those changes and push it to the data base so that it can post later on in the night and update the website. Not
            only was this part of it, but also changing the images as well was a major roll in this as they would need to update the images as they went through events or
            needed to add pictures of the events. This internship was challenging but it was well worth it as it was a lot of self learning and asking questions when needed.
            If I did need help, I would ask my colleagues and if they did not know then I would ask the lead developers for assistance and they would always point me in the
            right direction so I would not take up too much time on one specific task. Overall it was a great experience

        <button class="accordion">Multimedia Language Center</button>
        <div class="panel">
            When working at the Multimedia Language Center, it was a great experience as I got to meet many people and develop more skills for speaking and how to explain
            more issues when talking to people. If there was an issue with a computer, I would go to that computer and check what the problem was. It could be many things
            that could have gone wrong such as a keyboard or mouse not working, a hard drive not being read properly, or someones work not being saved properly. There were
            also times when I would proctor tests for master students and use a software to collect digital copies of their test in order to ensure they would have them saved.
            If there was anything wrong with the copy that was printed it would be saved in order to make sure they would be able to have all their data saved and stored so
            they could be graded accordingly.
            I also created a script in my time there which took in students data for what language course they were taking for the quarter and it would then be formatted so
            that the computer would be able to take that data and update the students information when they are logging in. This was all done through Visual Basic. And it was
            formatted in for a system known as FileMaker Pro.
            Another script that I had done was to make a PDF document, once filled out completely, it would take in specific portions from the document to create an email to
            the professor that was in charge of the program and send it to them for which course they were applying for and would then populate the email for them. After the
            person who created the PDF would also get a copy of that email and the professor would then be in charge of approving it. This was done using JavaScript.
