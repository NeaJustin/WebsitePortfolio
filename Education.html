            <h3>CSE 330: Data Structures</h3>
            <p>
                During my Data Structures course, we went over structure such as linked list, doubly linked list, Vectors, etc...
                <br />
                Under my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/justinhigh/cse330">CSE 330</a> is a list of my course work for CSE 330.
                Each lab containing a different assignment each week and also having homework assignments to help ensure we understand what we previously learned.
                It was rigorous but it was rewarding in that it did help me understand how each class does work.
            </p>

            <h3>CSE 431: Algorithm Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Algorithm Analysis is one that was extensively covered in that it was a lot of understanding heaps and sorting algorithms to imrpove time complexity.
                One of the main things was understanding why a program would take O(n), n^2, linear time, or it could be O(nlogn).
                Each one varying based on what the algorithm was, how we found it through proofs or through proof by induction.
                Also, when going through more proofs and from there finding ways to improve on the algorithm.
                One example would be merge sort in imporving the time complexity. Or using a sift-down algorithm to sort a binary tree when given an array of numbers being added in random order.
            </p>

            <h3>CSE 460: Operating Systems</h3>
            <p>
                Github: <a href="https://github.com/justinhigh/cse460">CSE 460</a>
                <br />
                For CSE 460, we were put into groups and the labs were broken up into three phases. Each phase consisting of different parts that would be used for the project.
                <br />
                It consisted of learning about memory management, time splicing, creating object files for the op codes to run, creating op codes to translate to bits,
                creating 3 different registers such as general purpose registers, SR (Status Register), and IR (Instruction Register).
                Throughout the project, we started implementing more things to help make it simulate an operating system such as paging, multi-threading, scheduling,
                and more things throughout. Each phase of the project can be found using the github link. Not all was created by me, some of it was provided in the beginning of the project.
            </p>

            <h3>CSE 461: Advanced Operating Systems</h3>
            <p>
                All the code was not written by me. Some of it was given as the skeleton. Majority of it was implemented by me.
                Github: <a href="https://github.com/justinhigh/cse461">CSE 461</a>
                <br />
                During advanced operating system, we were creating the file system of an operating system. This covered the Windows and Linux based operating systems.
                During the course we created a Disk, the sDisk, in which it would create the file and allocate how many bytes it would take up within a space.
                After which, we would have the fileSystem be able to either write to that existing file, or remove it or create a copy of it. Depending on what we would want to do after creation.
                The shell in the program would list all the files in the directory and give access to specific functions that were needed. Allowing people access only to what is necessary
                and not giving them too much access.
                Then the Table would be able to search for specific files in order to find what the user was looking for.
            </p>

            <h3>CSE 570: Compilers</h3>
            <p>
                In our compilers course, we learned about state tables and about parsers. There was much covered about what goes into a compiler and it was difficult. 
                Much of what we did learn was about state terminating strings and state tables themselves. We also did have another project for this course which
                required us to create a calculator that would save the previous state and add it on or do any other mathematic operation to the previous one. 
            </p>

            <h3>CSE 594/630: Theory Algorithms & Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Theory of algorithm analysis was a continuation of CSE 431: Algorithm Analysis. It went more into depth with more time complexity and improving upon algorithms.
                We went over more proofs as well, testing algorithms which one would run faster and placing them in order by proving it was O(n) or anything greater or lower.
                Overall, this course gave me a great understanding of furthering algorithms and it did make me appreciate the math a lot more.
                The course was taugh by Dr. Owen Murphy and he spoke heavily about mathmatics within the course as much of it does depend on your knowledge of it.
                Without many of the principles of mathmatics, much of the problems that we face would not be solveable.
                We also looked a lot more into graph theory in this course.

            <h3>CSE 512: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <p>
                For CSE 512, it was going over the understanding of AI using Python. Specifically Python 2.
                <br />
                When further going into the course, we learned about finding the shortes paths with algorithms such as DFS, BFS, A*, UCS, etc...
                After looking at each one and uderstanding which ones it the best of each one, it was good to be able to see how each one differed from each other.
                A* being the best of the three due to its time complexity and the parameters in which it takes. It is able to estimate the cost more efficiently and properly
                give the best path each time. Throughout the course we also built some games such as tic-tac-toe that would learn as each game progressed or it would be difficult
                the very first time depending on how it was set up. Going further into the topic, there was a lot more that needed to be discussed. Which then further went into
                my own interests for looking at different algorithms such as Random Forest algorithm. There are many more and I have been learning about PyTorch since then
                for the framework and working with tensors and gpu processing to learn more about it.
            </p>

            <h3>CSE 516: Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>
                In machine learning, we mainly went over specific algorithms such as KNN for Kth Nearest Neighbor. Other ones such as finding the shortest path through
                supervised learning. We used MatLab for our lab assignment which was not the best but it did its purpose in showing what was needed to be done.
                Each one was good learning experience for each lab and some of them were challenging. Namely the one with finding the shortest path as searching for edge cases
                was difficult. At the beginning it would not be able to find one if it at the edge of the grid but after some debugging the issue was fixed. Towards the end of
                the course, we had a project where we would take an image of a car and we would mark the image with a box and save it within an .txt file. After it would save the
                coordinates of it and would help determine what a car would look like. After, it was then running the program with negative data that was not yet tested and it would
                go through it and mark what it would find as a car. The machine did take overnight to train as this was a large number of pictures it needed to go through.
                Then after we were able to have it identify 4+ cars within one image that was found on a random google search for the project to be complete.
                Overall it was a great experience as it showed how a machine learns at a slow pace but it produces great results in the end.

            <h3>CSE 572: Database Systems</h3>
            <p>
                github link to all course work for <a href="https://github.com/justinhigh/cse572">CSE 572</a>.
                Database was very interesting in that it taught much about what went into the process of creating a fully functional database. Showing the relationship
                between different attributes of the diagram. There was much to learn about left join union, right join union, getting differnet data from other tables
                using the foreign key as a way to access different data tables. Throughout the course we learned about why there were one to many or many to many relationships
                within a database. At the end of the course we worked on a project for a mock database for a university where it would contain departments, students, and all
                the necessities within a school. After creating the tables and inserting the data, we created views for the data so that others would be able to access it.
                In my github you will find the project itself for the mock univeristy and all my other course work for labs throughout the course.
            </p>

            <h3>CSE 575: Internship</h3>
            <p>
                For my internship, I was apart of a team for Phi Beta Delta and we were creating more backend for the admin users. When we were discussing how the team would
                go through the implementation of it, we went through several ideas and some of them were not the best option. What we ended up deciding to do was create a 
                web scraper that would then take all the links or images that were found and put them into a JSON file. After doing so, any links that would be updated, 
                the web scraper would then take those links and update at midnight. This would fix the broken links. Then at midnight, any changes that were made and approved 
                would be pushed and made so that it would change any updates, change any images they had, fix any details that would need to be done. It all depended on
                the admins would use it for. Overall the project was great and help creating some of the features was overall a fun project.
